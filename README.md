# **Computer Graphics**
## B.Sc(hons) Computer Science
### Practical Guidelines
1. Write a program to implement _Bresenhams line drawing_ algorithm.
2. Write a program to implement _mid-point circle drawing_ algorithm.
3. Write a program to clip a line using _Cohen and Sutherland line clipping_ algorithm.
4. Write a program to clip a polygon using _Sutherland Hodgeman_ algorithm.
5. Write a program to fill a polygon using _Scan line fill_ algorithm.
6. Write a program to apply various 2D transformations on a 2D object (use homogeneous coordinates).
7. Write a program to apply various 3D transformation on a 3D object and then apply parallel and perspective projection on it.
8. Write a program to draw _Hermite/Bezier curve_.

_All the programs  have been done on turbo C++ as **graphics.h** is a necessary file to be imported._
